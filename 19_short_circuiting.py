# SHORT CIRCUIT EVALUATIONS

# logical operators are short circuit

# for and logical operators
# python checks the first condition, if it evaluates to the same as
# the second condition, it keeps checking the next until one of them
# evaluates to the contrary then it stps and returns false for the
# entire statement


# for or logical operators
# python checks the value of the first condition, compares it with the next,
# if they are the same, and if there is any other condition, it checks
# that one, if it finds it contary, it stops checking and evaluates the entire
# operation as True
