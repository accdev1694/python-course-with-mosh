# FUNCTIONS

# break code down into smaller more reuseable forms

def greet(first_name, last_name):
    print(f"hi {first_name} {last_name}")

# functions take parameters on creation
# they accept arguemets on call

# in programing there are two types of functions
# 1.  functrions that perfom a task, having a side effect - print()
# 2. functions that calculates and returns a value - round()
